    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yet another attempt at keeping a blog,
I hope to make this less of a catalogue of my thoughts (nobody is too interested in those anyway) and more of a loose collection of posts on many of my various assorted projects, interests and maybe even some of my work as a PhD student.</p>

<p>I decided against using Wordpress or similar software to power this site and instead to use a static blog, this is all done using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress link</a> and I like the result so far. (Not that there is anything wrong with Wordpress, but for what I&rsquo;m planing to do, its overkill.)</p>

<p> The lovely theme I&rsquo;ve used is called <a href="https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade">Greyshade link</a>. I had started work on something very similar a few months ago, but other stuff came up and I never came back to it. But I much prefer this theme to my own effort.</p>

<p>Anyway, awkward introductions over, I hope you will join me soon for some actual content.</p>
